```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

Load gff file 
```{r}
gff <- read.csv(file="~/Desktop/PutnamLab/Astrangia_Genome/apoculata_v2.0.gff3", header=FALSE, sep="\t") %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  dplyr::rename("seqname" = "V1",
                "source" = "V2",
                "feature" = "V3", 
                "start" = "V4",
                "end" = "V5",
                "score" = "V6",
                "strand" = "V7",
                "frame" = "V8",
                "attribute" = "V9")
```

Filter so that the three_prime_UTR is the only feature and calculate length of three_prime_UTR feature 
```{r}
three_prime_UTR_gff <- gff %>%
  filter(feature == "three_prime_UTR") %>%
  mutate(length = end - start)
```

There are only 687 entries for the three_prime_UTR...hmm. Why? Were not all of them identified? Do I need to ID them myself????
